**[Ongoing projects]**

**Oberrō** is a communal project in which practitioners from multiple fields and regions can engage and develop collaborative and experimental practices. The name Oberrō, which means both “to wander among” and “to err”, carries the founding concepts and structures of the project: as a non-physical platform for artistic thinking and making, composed by an ever-changing group of nomadic practitioners with a diverse or at times no topic or practice of focus, the project refutes the establishment of borders, becoming a morphing and erratic initiative which envisions a diverse range of experimental practices, thus accepting the possibility and potentials of error/failures. 

**The Exhibition Space as a Laboratory** is a research project which aims to intersect Curatorial Studies with Software Studies, in order to develop an exhibition platform where agents from multiple fields can collaboratively build an environment which embeds experimentation at its core. The project aims to transform the exhibition space into a “laboratory”, where the exhibition is made open to experimentation of multiple natures (artistic, curatorial and scientific), becoming a space not only for the experience of art, but also for research, innovation and knowledge production.

**Bite to Byte** platform launch - a video documentation project which explores the potentials of online culture and 
platforms in order to share experiences, knowledge and concerns regarding food distribution issues across the globe. 
As an artistic project developed for Ok.Video web residency, it aims to expand the notions of video documentation, 
online exhibition and archiving in times of online video sharing platforms and social broadcasting softwares such as 
Youtube, Twitch and Hangout.
