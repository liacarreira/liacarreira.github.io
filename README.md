**[Ongoing projects]**

[**Oberrō**](https://oberro.github.io/) is a communal project in which practitioners from multiple fields and regions engage and develop collaborative and experimental practices. The name Oberrō, which means both “to wander among” and “to err”, carries the founding concepts and structures of the project: as a non-physical platform for artistic thinking and making, composed by an ever-changing group of nomadic practitioners with diverse backgrounds, the project refutes the establishment of borders, becoming a morphing and erratic initiative which envisions a diverse range of experimental practices, thus accepting the possibility and potentials of error/failures. 
> [Oberrō Artist-run Residencies (OARs)](https://oaresidencies.github.io/)

**The Exhibition Space as a Laboratory** is a research project in the intersection of Curatorial Studies with Software Studies, which aims to transform the exhibition space into a “laboratory”, where the exhibition is made open to experimentation of multiple natures (artistic, curatorial and scientific), becoming a space not only for the experience of art, but also for research, innovation and knowledge production.

**Bite to Byte** is a video documentation project which explores the potentials of online culture and 
platforms in order to share experiences, knowledge and concerns regarding food distribution issues across the globe. 
As an artistic project developed for Ok.Video web residency, it aims to expand the notions of video documentation, 
online exhibition and archiving in times of online video sharing platforms and social broadcasting softwares such as 
Youtube, Twitch and Hangout.
