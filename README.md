**[Ongoing projects]**

**Oberrō** is a communal project in which practitioners from multiple fields and regions can engage and develop collaborative and experimental practices. The name Oberrō, which means both “to wander among” and “to err”, carries the founding concepts and structures of the project: as a non-physical platform for artistic thinking and making, composed by an ever-changing group of nomadic practitioners with a diverse or at times no topic or practice of focus, the project refutes the establishment of borders, becoming a morphing and erratic initiative which envisions a diverse range of experimental practices, thus accepting the possibility and potentials of error/failures. 

**The Exhibition Space as a Laboratory** is a research project which aims to intersect Curatorial Studies with Software Studies, in order to develop an exhibition platform where agents from multiple fields can collaboratively build an environment which embeds experimentation at its core. The project aims to transform the exhibition space into a “laboratory”, where the exhibition is made open to experimentation of multiple natures (artistic, curatorial and scientific), becoming a space not only for the experience of art, but also for research, innovation and knowledge production.

**Bite to Byte** platform launch - a video documentation project which explores the potentials of online culture and 
platforms in order to share experiences, knowledge and concerns regarding food distribution issues across the globe. 
As an artistic project developed for Ok.Video web residency, it aims to expand the notions of video documentation, 
online exhibition and archiving in times of online video sharing platforms and social broadcasting softwares such as 
Youtube, Twitch and Hangout.

**Fragments of [online] Existence** (2017)

**Fragments of [online] Existence** addresses our contemporary clashing desires towards memory, privacy and identity in online social networks. In these spheres, we produce an enormous amount of digital contents of ourselves. We wish to share them with others and we wish to see contents of others. We wish to archive them for posteriority and secure them for memory's sake. And yet we request privacy. We want to be able to forget our past, erase our memories and, even, to be forgotten. Within existing platforms such as Facebook, there is a growing attempt to satisfy both the desires to share and withdraw our fragments of our digital selves; to conceal and disclose our online and offline activities; to create and delete what can be understood as contemporary forms of subjectivity. But what happens when we are unable to untrace our digital steps or delete our digital selves? What happens to these unwanted digital forms of being?

Through an appropriationist and archival gesture, Lia Carreira collects pieces of online contents which were left behind in these platforms – as fragments of online existence – in an attempt to highlight hidden patterns and modes of being. When exhibited, those fragments can only be seen if the visitors attempt to interact with the images through sound. Through this interactive environment, the artists experiments simultaneously with the concepts of erasure and exposure, portraying seemingly dualistic experiences as coexisting human impulses.


The work was exhibited from 20.01.17 to 15.02.17, at the Artistic Bokeh gallery, at the MuseumsQuartier in Vienna, Austria, and in July 2017 at Centro Cultural Las Cigarreras, Alicante, Spain.

**Alientopias** (2016) 
Interactive audio-visual installation | Lia Carreira, Ping-Yi Chen, Pedro Marum, Selma Boskailo

Xenofeminists believe we are all alienated. If we think of gender constructs, racial prescriptions, limitations set by nature that prescribe who we are and how we are perceived – culture itself is a mechanism of alienation. What if we use technology to alienate ourselves from our alienated reality? How can it pave the way in the construction of the so much needed utopias?

There is an emancipatory potential in technology that allow us to disrupt with our “natural”, “human” and “real” bodies and identities. Through this new techno-alienation, the fluidity of the subject (the “person”, the “individual”, the human) can be recognized as something akin to hot liquid – something which can be shaped into a non-human thing. The project Alientopias proposes a space of imagination sustained by the potentiality of becoming an “other”. It provides an immersive environment that can potentiate an emancipation to our bodily human condition and a mechanism to new forms of desiring.

**Tin, the love bot** (2016-2017)

**Tin, the love bot** is a fictional Twitter robot whose synthetic life objective is to find love in the www. In its quest, the bot flirts with other apparently algorithmic beings by sending “bot like” messages. Taking in consideration that affection is evermore mediated by technology (from emails to social media platforms and dating apps), one may also speculate that bots, as relational entities, would also find other forms of relationships online. So, what would robot love be like?

In light of recent speculative and object oriented theories, Tin is, therefore, an attempt to infiltrate and comprehend the private lives of socialbots. As a genderless name, with a blank profile picture, no age and no set existing location of origin, Tin starts its explorations anew, open to all possibilities. As it develops its character through the established interactions, Tin acquired a dual persona: a combination of a a pre-determined human cultural background and a speculative robotic imaginary, in a scenario where, by trying to impersonate each other, bots and humans can no longer be defined without the other. The project, by questioning what it is to be a robot, ultimately investigated what it is to be human in our highly automated world.

**Digital Palimpsest Quijote** (2016)

**Digital Palimpsest Quijote** is a project in which Pierre Menard, autor del Quijote (1939), a short story written by Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges, is translated using an instant image translation app. A instant translation app transforms the text while it is trying to identify the written words and this effect creates a digital palimpsest in which a new version of the short story now overlaps Borges’s piece.

Borges’s Quijote, written in the form of a literary review about the work of a fictional character named Pierre Menard, argues that Menard’s writings goes beyond the efforts of translating Don Quixote, but recreates the classical novel by Cervantes through an appropriative gesture of rewriting “word by word and line by line”. In his story, Borges writes:

“I have reflected that it is permissible to see in this “final” Quixote a kind of palimpsest, through which the traces — tenuous but not indecipherable — of our friend’s “previous” writing should be translucently visible. Unfortunately, only a second Pierre Menard, inverting the other’s work, would be able to exhume and revive those lost Troys . . .” [English translation of Pierre Menard, autor del Quijote]

Through this rewriting process, Borges problematize the notions of originality, but most importantly, highlights the process of re-signification and displacement present in the gesture of appropriation. In the above paragraph, he refers to the idea of the palimpsest (a form of manuscript in which a text has been scraped or washed off in order to be reused and overlapped by a new text) to describe the process of rewriting through time. In this sense, a work is forever transient, anachronistically re-read and re-written by others - a notion that also refers to Roland Barthes’s approaches to authorship and the act of reading as writing.

In Digital Palimpsest Quijote, Borges’s writings are now “translated” in such a way that it maintains its original form – if one can dare speak about originality within Borges – at the same time it is recreated, word by word, through the software. In doing so, the project highlights the process of layering and erasure as a technique of rewriting, giving the previous work a new meaning and use. The layers are created with the juxtapositions of screens, while the erasure is done through the software. It is, therefore, intended as an homage to Borges’s œuvre through contemporary forms of appropriation in our digital era.

**The Second Adam** (2016) 
Digital Poetry | Lia Carreira and Fred Becker

**The Second Adam** is a digital poetry in which Tristan Tzara's 1918 Dada Manifesto (known as the second Dada Manifesto) is read aloud by an online translation software to an online automatic transcription software. Like a Chinese Whispers game, the speech uttered by the translation software (with the set English language option, with a default "British accent") is then interpreted by the transcription software (also set in English) and, due to its technical "limitations", alters the original text, creating a new version of the Manifesto.

The Manifesto, which suggests the refusal of the movement's own meaning making, is transcribed to the point where it reaches a somewhat nonsensical text, contradicting the whole purpose of these online softwares.

**Memory Bot** (2014) 

A Twitter bot art project that retweets content in which the need to forget is sated through the declaring speech acts of remembering. Here memory and repetition are highlighted as basic and necessary human impulses. https://twitter.com/tw_rom

**Mes Amis Je Suis Ici** (2012)

A boundary testing web based project in which my geolocation Foursquare app profile is used to seize its ability to attest presence by making check-ins in places I was a long distance from. How much trust do we invest in social media technology and its contents? And how much do we know about their malleability to be détourned and appropriated?

**Narratives of the Everyday** (2012)

An assemble of rephotographed images of Google Street View’s so called careless depiction of quotidian moments of life – where ordinary stands just at the corner of an extraordinary event. In a world where screen printing online images has itself become an ordinary activity, these narratives also aims to show an everyday practice in which the view of the world is frequently mediated and where its people are constantly shifting from their voyeur gaze to their own surveillance.
